        <h2>Why Typography Still Matters (in a world of copy-and-paste)</h2>
        <p>
          Screens made type feel free: a font file moves as easily as any other file, and most apps don’t stop you from copying it.
          But typography is still shaped by contracts, law, and business models—many of which were designed when type was metal, not software.
          That mismatch explains why people casually pass fonts around, why companies get compliance letters, and why small foundries and big aggregators clash over money and control.
          Filed lawsuits are uncommon, but letters and settlements are routine—<strong>which is why keeping receipts for licenses (and knowing what you’re allowed to do) really matters.</strong>
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <p><strong>Our standard:</strong> Use the <em>Google static</em> versions of Roboto and Roboto Serif. Avoid mixing vendor versions (Adobe vs. Google) to keep files and renders consistent across design tools, Microsoft apps, and motion (After Effects/Premiere).</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>How Typefaces Work Today (the file behind the letterforms)</h2>
        <h3>Typeface vs. font</h3>
        <p>
          A <strong>typeface</strong> is the design (the shapes). A <strong>font</strong> is the software that produces those shapes in apps and browsers—OpenType/TrueType for desktop, WOFF/WOFF2 on the web.
        </p>
        <h3>What’s inside a font file</h3>
        <p>
          Vector outlines (Bezier points), metrics, kerning classes, hinting/instructions, and OpenType features (ligatures, small caps, stylistic sets).
          <strong>Variable fonts</strong> bundle families into axes (weight, width, optical size…) so one file can morph.
        </p>
        <h3>Why copying is easy</h3>
        <p>
          The file is small; your OS/application will happily load a duplicate; nothing in the file “phones home.”
          Most limits live in the EULA (license text), not in the code—so <strong>over‑installing or embedding beyond your rights is surprisingly easy to do by mistake.</strong>
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Copying in the Digital Age: “How do people get away with it?”</h2>
        <p><strong>Short answer:</strong> because the law distinguishes the design from the software, and because the practical friction is low.</p>
        <div class="grid">
          <div>
            <h3>United States</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>The <strong>shape of a typeface</strong> is not protected by U.S. copyright (<em>Eltra v. Ringer</em>, 1978; USCO guidance).</li>
              <li>But the <strong>font software</strong> is protectable as a computer program; copying the digital outlines/code can infringe (<em>Adobe v. Southern Software</em>, 1998).</li>
              <li><strong>Result:</strong> it’s legally simple to redraw a public‑domain typeface, but not to duplicate someone’s font file.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Europe & the UK</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>The EU protects designs (including typefaces) via Community design law (registered up to 25 years; unregistered for 3 years).</li>
              <li>The UK’s CDPA also has specific provisions for typefaces.</li>
              <li>Because copying feels trivial, many users over‑install fonts or embed them beyond license terms—often unintentionally. Public lawsuits are rare; <strong>contact + settlement</strong> is far more common.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>The Business of Fonts (and why enforcement feels aggressive)</h2>
        <h3>Aggregators & audits</h3>
        <p>
          Large firms consolidate libraries and sell enterprise‑scale subscriptions; they also audit usage and pursue retroactive licensing when they believe fonts were used beyond the license.
          Even critics agree that demand letters are more common than court cases.
        </p>
        <h3>Monotype as an example</h3>
        <p>
          Monotype has rolled up many classic libraries and went private in 2019 (acquired by HGGC).
          The company markets compliance/“we’ll handle claims and settlements” services to enterprises—illustrating how enforcement itself is part of the offering.
        </p>
        <div class="tip">
          <strong>Design takeaway:</strong> keep a license inventory, decide who in your org buys and tracks fonts, and standardize on a vetted set (or an enterprise plan) to reduce risk.
          Industry reporting and counsel guidance both stress that most pain comes from <strong>under‑licensing</strong>, not from overt piracy.
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>History & Law: from metal to software (and a legal framework that lagged)</h2>
        <div class="grid">
          <div>
            <h3>Metal & photo era → high friction</h3>
            <p>Copying required physical matrices or film masters—expensive and slow—so the market priced around scarcity.</p>
            <h3>Desktop era → low friction</h3>
            <p>
              PostScript/TrueType/OpenType turned fonts into files. U.S. law didn’t extend copyright to the shape of typefaces (see <em>Eltra</em>; USCO Circular 33),
              though you can copyright the program that generates them. In Europe and the UK, design law fills that gap.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Key U.S. cases & guidance</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><em>Eltra v. Ringer</em> (4th Cir. 1978): typeface designs not copyrightable.</li>
              <li><em>Adobe v. Southern Software</em> (N.D. Cal. 1998): font software/code can be copyrighted.</li>
              <li>USCO Circular 33 / Compendium: “Typeface, fonts, and lettering” generally not protected; computer programs that generate typefaces may be registrable.</li>
              <li>UK CDPA (1988): special treatment for typefaces and use exceptions; separate design right regime.</li>
              <li>EU (Reg. 6/2002; EUIPO guidelines): Community designs protect appearance of products (including type), with clear registration/term rules.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>What “getting sued” actually looks like</h2>
        <p>
          Public, reported font cases exist—but the modal outcome is a demand letter and a settlement (often retroactive licensing).
          Examples often cited in industry press include NBCUniversal’s settlement over Chalet (reported as a record amount at the time), and other brand disputes; the pattern is that misuse is alleged to exceed what the EULA allowed.
        </p>
        <div class="callout">
          <p><strong>Practical tip:</strong> If you inherit brand assets, audit the font rights you truly have (desktop, web, app, broadcast, ebook, server, embedding, user/seat counts). Many headaches start with “we thought the agency handled it.”</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Fun facts & fundamentals (sprinkle as sidebars)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The first U.S. design patent ever (1842) was for a typeface. A reminder that law has sometimes treated letterforms as protectable designs.</li>
          <li><strong>Why Helvetica was everywhere.</strong> Bundling with operating systems turbocharged adoption—distribution beats taste.</li>
          <li><strong>Variable fonts aren’t new in spirit.</strong> Multiple‑master fonts in the 1990s anticipated today’s axes, but tooling and browser support finally caught up.</li>
          <li><strong>Web embedding ≠ desktop rights.</strong> A WOFF license rarely grants desktop installs; app and broadcast are usually separate SKUs. (Always check the EULA.)</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Where Typography Goes Next (so we don’t “ruin it for everyone”)</h2>
        <h3>Open licensing at scale</h3>
        <p>
          The SIL Open Font License and large public libraries (e.g., Google Fonts) have shifted expectations about access—good for adoption, but still requires attribution and respecting license terms.
        </p>
        <h3>Better ops</h3>
        <p>Teams that treat fonts like any other licensed software (central purchasing, tracking, and renewals) avoid drama and save money.</p>
        <h3>Healthier economics</h3>
        <p>If organizations budget for type like they do for images or music, independent foundries thrive, and designers get better tools.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>A realistic “How to be good with fonts” checklist</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Decide your sources.</strong> Buy from the foundry, an authorized reseller, or a vetted enterprise plan—avoid random “free font” sites.</li>
          <li><strong>Scope the rights.</strong> Desktop? Web? App? Broadcast? Server? Subset/embedding allowed?</li>
          <li><strong>Track installs.</strong> Seat counts matter. Centralize.</li>
          <li><strong>Transfer cleanly.</strong> When work changes hands (agency → client), transfer or re‑license.</li>
          <li><strong>Prefer open or enterprise where sensible.</strong> Reduce overhead for common, high‑traffic use; reserve boutique licenses for hero branding.</li>
        </ul>
