## MARKETING POTLUCK INTAKE DUMP (Revised for the Guide)

**Collected from:** Slack, email, a shared sign-up doc, calendar invites, and Facilities/HR notes.  
**Status:** High ambiguity, conflicting constraints, unclear owner/decision rights.

---

### A) Slack — #marketing-general (Event kickoff + constraints)
- **Tara (Sr. Marketing Manager):** “Marketing potluck next Thursday. Can someone own coordination? Keep it low lift.”
- **Dylan (Director of Brand):** “Suggest a theme and presentation standards. I’ll advise on ‘vibe’.”
- **Mina (Design):** “Please avoid strong-smelling foods; we’ve had odor complaints.”
- **Becky (Marketing Ops):** “We must label allergens clearly. Last time was chaotic.”
- **Jordan (Paid Media):** “Please avoid spicy ‘mystery’ foods; label heat level.”
- **Raj (SEO):** “Severe nut allergy (tree nuts + peanuts). Also avoid cross-contamination.”

### B) Slack DM — Tara → Coordinator/DRI (Leadership pressure + budget)
- “Leadership wants it to feel ‘special’ with **no budget**. Please keep it simple and avoid anything that triggers Facilities.”

### C) Email — “Marketing Potluck — Quick Notes!” (Incomplete logistics + conflicting expectations)
- Date: “Next Thursday” (**no actual date**)
- Time: “Lunch-ish (12–2?)”
- Location: “Kitchen area / maybe Conf Room B” (**Room B is already booked**)
- “Be mindful of allergies.”
- “Should look nice for photos.”
- Attachment: `potluck_notes_FINAL.xlsx` (**locked / access controlled**)

### D) Calendar Invite #1 (Basic event)
- Title: “Marketing Potluck”
- Time: 12:00–1:00
- Location: Kitchen
- Notes: “Bring a dish. Label allergens.”
- Invitees: Marketing + some non-Marketing groups (scope unclear)

### E) Calendar Invite #2 — sent later by Dylan (Conflicts with Invite #1)
- Title: “Theme Experience” (Dylan’s version)
- Time: 11:30–2:30
- Location: Atrium (**Atrium unavailable due to Finance offsite**)
- Rules listed (presentation-focused): “No plastic,” “no visible appliances,” “neutral linens,” etc.
- Attachment: `MOODBOARD.pdf`

### F) Shared “Potluck Sign-Up” doc (Messy source of truth)
**Columns:** Name, Dish, Allergens, Dietary notes, Serving notes, Notes  
**Current entries (examples):**
- Steph: “Chili” (allergens unknown; crockpot mentioned)
- Raj: “TBD” (nut allergy emphasized; additional restrictions unclear)
- Eli: “Dessert (almond flour?)” (conflicts with nut-free requirement)
- Mina: “Charcuterie board” (dairy/meat; special serving/cleanup notes)
- Becky: “Plates/cups/labels” (bringing label template)
- Dylan: “Centerpiece / setup” (wants presentation control)
- “Kombucha flight” added, with multiple objections (not consensus)

### G) Facilities guidance (Hard constraints)
- No open flames.
- No extension cords across walkways.
- Crockpots only if plugged directly into wall outlets and not left unattended.
- Avoid wall attachments/damage.
- Avoid glitter/decor that creates cleanup issues.
- Request: avoid strong-smelling foods (seafood noted as a common complaint).

### H) HR guidance (Policy constraints)
- Participation must be voluntary; avoid “mandatory fun” framing.
- Avoid pressure on employees with dietary restrictions or other constraints.
- No alcohol at lunch.

### I) Finance note (Space conflict)
- Atrium is booked all day Thursday; do not use Atrium or borrow Finance tables.

### J) Leadership note (Success criteria, still vague)
- VP/Leadership: “Keep it simple, but it’s a morale moment and we may have visitors. Don’t spend money.”

### K) CEO/Executive constraint (High priority requirement)
- CEO may stop by briefly.
- Needs at least one option that is **gluten-free**, **dairy-free**, and generally “safe.”
- Additional note: “Whole30-ish” (interpretation needed; don’t assume).

### L) Open questions / contradictions (intentionally unresolved)
- What is the actual **date** (“next Thursday”)?
- What is the final **time window** (12–1 vs 12–2 vs 11:30–2:30)?
- What is the final **location** (Kitchen vs Conf Room B vs Atrium)?
- Is this **Marketing-only** or broader (“All Staff” invite sprawl)?
- Who is the **DRI** and who has decision rights on “theme” vs “simple”?
- How strict is “nut-free” (full potluck vs dedicated table)?
- Are crockpots allowed (Facilities says yes with constraints; Dylan says “no visible appliances”)?
