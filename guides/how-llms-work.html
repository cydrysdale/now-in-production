        <h2>What this guide is for</h2>

        <div class="">
          <div>
            <p class="kicker">
              You’ve probably used ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or Copilot—and perhaps you even went a little crazy and tried Grok. You’ve seen AI do impressive things. You also may have seen it confidently state that there are two R's in strawberry.
            </p>
            <p>
              While this guide won’t make you an AI researcher, it will give you the information you need to:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Write better prompts that get more predictable, verifiable results</li>
              <li>Understand why AI “forgets,” drifts, or hallucinates</li>
              <li>Run multi-step workflows that produce usable results</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The AI restaurant sim</h3>
            <p>
              Throughout this guide, we'll be using a kitchen sim metaphor to help reinforce each concept:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The <strong>Cook (AI model)</strong> works quickly, but can only create using the ingredients and tools in front of them.</li>
              <li>Your <strong>Order Ticket (prompt)</strong> is the objective, rules, and output format: what to cook, substitutions/allergies, and how to plate it.</li>
              <li>The <strong>Prep Counter (context)</strong> is everything the chef has right in front of them to work with: attachments or links submitted with the prompt.</li>
              <li>Your <strong>Inventory (context window)</strong> is limited. The counter space gets too crowded, older items might fall off.</li>
              <li><strong>Tools (calendar, spreadsheet, search)</strong> determine if the chef has access to a pantry for extra ingredients, cookbooks to research recipes, or use an appliance like a brulee torch.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="truth"><strong>Kitchen truth:</strong> Our chefs may be brilliant, but they have a limited attention span—if it’s not on the ticket or the counter, it doesn’t exist.</div>

        <h2>Mise en Place: How LLMs Generate Text (and Why the Prompt Matters)</h2>
          <p>
            Everyone around you has probably been raving about AI recently. Your social media feed is full of influencers showing how AI sends them a text every morning with a daily to do list, plans all their meals, and reads them a bedtime story at night. 
          </p>
            <div class="grid callout">
              <div>
                <p>
                  So, you decide to try it out by asking for something simple, it answers confidently:
                </p>
                <div class="code" data-label="Grok">
                  <div><p><strong>Who would win in a fight in 2025? Elon Musk or Mike Tyson?</strong></p></div>

                  <div class="code-type animate">Mike Tyson packs legendary knockout power that could end it quick, but Elon's relentless endurance from 100-hour weeks and adaptive mindset outlasts even prime fighters in prolonged scraps. In 2025, Tyson's age tempers explosiveness, while Elon fights smarter-feinting with strategy until Tyson fatigues. Elon takes the win through grit and ingenuity, not just gloves.<span class="cursor animate">_</span></div>
                </div>
              </div>
              <div class="mini-widget">
                <p id="tokenParagraph">
                  This isn't necessarily because that AI model is faulty or inferior to another model that gave you a better answer. It could be a result of a bad prompt or improper utilization of that particular model. Which is why it's important to understand how LLMs work and how they generate text.
                <br><br>
                  It's best to think of an LLM as a chef or line cook at a restaurant. It doesn’t cook the whole dish in one step. It adds one ingredient (small chunk of text called a <strong>token</strong>) at a time. After each ingredient, it reviews what’s available on the <strong>prep counter (context)</strong> and the <strong>order ticket (prompt)</strong>, then asks: “Given what I can see right now, what’s the most plausible next ingedient?”
                </p>
                <button class="sandbox-btn" id="toggleTokens" type="button" aria-pressed="false" aria-controls="tokenParagraph">
                  Highlight tokens
                </button>
              </div>
        </div>

        <div class="truth"><strong>Kitchen truth:</strong> Tokens aren't just how the model reads and generates text—they also determine pricing, latency, and maximum output length.</div>

        <h3>Your phone already does this (badly)</h3>
        <p>
          You've actually seen this mechanism before: start typing a text message and your phone suggests the next word.
          Type "I went to the" and it offers "store" | "park" | "hospital."
          That's next-word prediction—the same core idea behind every LLM.
        </p>
        <p>
          The difference? Your phone's keyboard uses a simple lookup: "what word most commonly follows these last one or two words?"
          It doesn't know you were planning a beach trip three messages ago. It doesn't understand context—it understands <strong>frequency</strong>.
        </p>

        <div class="truth"><strong>Kitchen truth:</strong> Your phone's autocomplete is the world's smallest, dumbest cook—it only sees the last ingredient on the counter.</div>

        <div class="sandbox-card" id="predictGame">
          <p id="pgProgress" class="note" style="margin:0 0 4px"></p>
          <div class="code" data-label="Complete the sentence:">
            <div class="code-type" id="pgSentence" style="min-height:1.4em"></div>
          </div>
          <div id="pgChoices"></div>
          <div id="pgReveal" class="callout" style="display:none" aria-live="polite"></div>
          <button id="pgNext" class="sandbox-btn" type="button" style="display:none">Next round</button>
        </div>

        <h3>The upgrade: looking at the whole counter</h3>
        <p>
          LLMs use the same core mechanic—predict the next token—but instead of glancing at the last word or two,
          they look at everything currently on the counter (the full context window).
          That's why an LLM can connect "surgeon" to "scalpel" even when they're sentences apart:
          an <strong>attention mechanism</strong> lets it link distant but relevant ingredients.
        </p>

        <div class="truth"><strong>Kitchen truth:</strong> Your phone keyboard is a cook who only looks at the last ingredient added. An LLM is a cook who glances at the whole counter—but it's still cooking one ingredient at a time.</div>

        <details class="tip">
          <summary><strong>Power-up (optional): N-grams—the phone's cheat sheet</strong></summary>
          <p>
            An <strong>n-gram</strong> is a sequence of <em>n</em> consecutive words. Your phone's predictions are powered by tables of these:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Unigram (n = 1):</strong> single-word frequency. "The" is one of the most common English words, so it gets suggested constantly.</li>
            <li><strong>Bigram (n = 2):</strong> word pairs. After "of the" → "most" | "best" | "world." After "going to" → "be" | "the" | "get."</li>
            <li><strong>Trigram (n = 3):</strong> three-word chains. "One of the" → "most." "I want to" → "go" | "be" | "know."</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The phone stores a frequency table of these sequences (often personalized to your texting habits) and picks the highest-scoring match.
            The window is tiny—usually 1–3 words—so it has no ability to track meaning, themes, or instructions from earlier in the conversation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Try this: open your phone, type a word, then keep tapping the middle suggestion 20 times. You'll get a grammatically
            plausible but meaningless sentence—that's n-gram prediction running on autopilot with no broader understanding.
          </p>
        </details>

        <details class="tip">
          <summary><strong>Power-up (optional): Attention—how LLMs look at the whole counter</strong></summary>
          <p>
            In n-gram prediction, the model only sees a fixed window of 1–3 words. LLMs replace that tiny window with a mechanism called <strong>attention</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            For each new token the model is about to generate, attention assigns a <strong>relevance score</strong> between that position and
            every other token already on the counter. Think of it as the cook glancing back across all the ingredients and deciding which ones matter <em>right now</em>:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Generating after "up the"—attention lights up "surgeon" from earlier, boosting "scalpel."</li>
            <li>Generating after "with the"—attention lights up "marine biology," boosting "dolphins."</li>
            <li>Generating after "is the"—attention links "planets," "solar system," and "Jupiter," boosting "largest."</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This is the core of the <strong>transformer</strong> architecture (the "T" in GPT): instead of a fixed lookback window,
            every token can attend to every other token. The model learns <em>which</em> connections matter during training.
          </p>
          <p>
            The tradeoff: attention across all tokens is computationally expensive and scales with counter size—which is
            one reason context windows have limits and longer prompts cost more.
          </p>
        </details>

        <h3>Same prompt, different response</h3>
        <p>
          You may have noticed that entering the same prompt into the same LLM can produce different answers. The is because when the model generates text, it considers lots of possibilities for the next word (token) and scores them. Then the system <strong>chooses one</strong> based on a setting refered to as the <strong>tempurature</strong> which controls how strongly it sticks to the top choice vs. how willing it is to take a less-likely option.
        </p><p>  
          Imagine ordering chocolate chip cookies for dessert—a temperature of 0 means the chef follows the standard recipe exactly as written. A tempurature of 1 means the chef will put its own spin on the recipe, so you might get oatmeal chocolate chip or browned butter pecan, but you're still getting cookies. Now a tempurature of 2 means the chef can get truly creative and you might end up receiving spaghetti and watermelon balls with a chocolate marinara, topped with a candied fennel garnish.
        </p>
        <div class="grid">
          <div class="callout">
            <h3 style="margin-top:0">Standard recipe</h3>
            <p style="margin:0">Stable and repeatable (nearly the same each run).</p>
          </div>
          <div class="callout">
            <h3 style="margin-top:0">Chef’s special</h3>
            <p style="margin:0">Varied and improvisational (poetic or pure nonsense).</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="truth"><strong>Kitchen truth:</strong> Most models you'll encounter have a set tempurature, but some models do allow you to adjust it yourself.</div>

        <div class="sandbox-card" id="tempDemo">
          <label for="tempSlider" class="sandbox-label"><strong>Try it: drag the tempurature slider to complete the sentence</strong></label>
          <div style="display:flex; align-items:center; gap:12px">
            <span class="note">Standard recipe</span>
            <input id="tempSlider" type="range" min="0" max="100" value="0" step="1"
              style="flex:1; min-width:120px" aria-label="Temperature slider from 0 to 2" />
            <span class="note">Chef's special</span>
          </div>
          <div style="text-align:center; margin:6px 0">
            <span class="badge" id="tempValue">Temperature: 0.0</span>
          </div>
          <div class="code" data-label="LLM output:">
            <div class="code-type" style="white-space:normal">The sky is<span id="tempOutput">...</span><span class="cursor animate">_</span></div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Why prompts matter more than people expect</h3>
        <p>
          The model’s default job is to produce a coherent continuation of whatever you put in front of it.
          If your prompt is vague, “coherent” often means it picks an interpretation it thinks is most likely and commits—hello, <strong>chocolate spaghetti with watermelon</strong>.
          If your prompt is specific (gluten-free vegan chocolate chip cookies with cinnamon, no fruit or nuts), “coherent” shifts towards what you actually want.
        </p>

        <details class="tip">
          <summary><strong>TL;DR</strong></summary>
          <ul>
            <li>Your order ticket (prompt) tells the chef (LLM model) what you want.</li>
            <li>The chef then cooks your order one ingredient (token) at a time.</li> 
            <li>A more specific order ticket doesn't make the chef better at cooking—it provides the chef more context to make your order the way you envisioned.</li>
            <li>Different chefs can cook the same order in vastly different ways. If you want the standard recipe, Copilot might be your best bet; but if you're feeling adventurous and have a steel gut, Grok is ready with the Chef's special.</li>
