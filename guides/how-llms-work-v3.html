              You’ve probably used ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or Copilot—and perhaps you even went a little crazy and tried Grok. You’ve seen AI do impressive things. You also may have seen it confidently state that there are two R's in strawberry.
            </p>
            <p>
              While this guide won’t make you an AI researcher, it will give you the information you need to:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Write better prompts that get more predictable, verifiable results</li>
              <li>Understand why AI “forgets,” drifts, or hallucinates</li>
              <li>Run multi-step workflows that produce usable results</li>

            <h3>The AI restaurant sim</h3>
            <p>
              Troughout this guide, we'll be using a kitchen sim metaphor to help reinforce each concept:

            <ul>
              <li>The <strong>Cook (AI model)</strong> works quickly, but can only create using the ingredients and tools in front of them</li>
              <li>Your <strong>Order Ticket (prompt)</strong> is the objective, rules, and output format: what to cook, substitutions/allergies, and how to plate it</li>
              <li>The <strong>Prep Counter (context)</strong> is everything the chef has right in front of them to work with: attachments or links submitted with the prompt</li>
              <li>Your <strong>Inventory (context window)</strong> is limited. The counter space gets too crowded, older items might fall off</li>
              <li><strong>Tools (calendar, spreadsheet, search)</strong> determine if the chef has access to a pantry for extra ingredients, cookbooks to research recipes, or use an appliance like a brulee torch</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Mise en Place: How LLMs Generate Text (and Why the Prompt Matters)</h2>
          <p>
            Everyone around you has probably been raving about AI recently. Your social media feed is full of influencers showing how AI sends them a text every morning with a daily to do list, plans all their meals, and reads them a bedtime story at night. 
          </p>
            <div class="grid callout">
              <div>
                <p>
                  So, you decide to try it out by asking for something simple, it answers confidently:
                </p>
                <div class="code" data-label="Grok">
                  <div><p><strong>Who would win in a fight in 2025? Elon Musk or Mike Tyson?</strong></p></div>

                  <div class="code-type animate">Mike Tyson packs legendary knockout power that could end it quick, but Elon's relentless endurance from 100-hour weeks and adaptive mindset outlasts even prime fighters in prolonged scraps. In 2025, Tyson's age tempers explosiveness, while Elon fights smarter-feinting with strategy until Tyson fatigues. Elon takes the win through grit and ingenuity, not just gloves.<span class="cursor animate">_</span></div>

                  This isn't necessarily because that AI model is faulty or inferior to another model that gave you a better answer. It could be a result of a bad prompt or improper utilization of that particular model. Which is why it's important to understand how LLMs work and how they generate text.
                <br><br>
                  It's best to think of an LLM as a chef or line cook at a restaurant. It doesn’t cook the whole dish in one step. It adds one ingredient (small chunk of text called a <strong>token</strong>) at a time. After each ingredient, it reviews what’s available on the <strong>prep counter (context)</strong> and the <strong>order ticket (prompt)</strong>, then asks: “Given what I can see right now, what’s the most plausible next ingedient?”
                </p>
                <button class="sandbox-btn" id="toggleTokens" type="button" aria-pressed="false" aria-controls="tokenParagraph">
                  Highlight tokens
                </button>
              </div>
        </div>

        <div class="truth"><strong>Kitchen truth:</strong> Tokens aren't just how the model reads and generates text—they also determine pricing, latency, and maximum output length.</div>

        <h3>Your phone already does this (badly)</h3>
        <p>
          You've actually seen this mechanism before: start typing a text message and your phone suggests the next word.
          Type "I went to the" and it offers "store" | "park" | "hospital."
          That's next-word prediction—the same core idea behind every LLM.
        </p>
        <p>
          The difference? Your phone's keyboard uses a simple lookup: "what word most commonly follows these last one or two words?"
          It doesn't know you were planning a beach trip three messages ago. It doesn't understand context—it understands <strong>frequency</strong>.
        </p>

        <div class="truth"><strong>Kitchen truth:</strong> Your phone's autocomplete is the world's smallest, dumbest cook—it only sees the last ingredient on the counter.</div>

        <div class="sandbox-card" id="predictGame">
          <p id="pgProgress" class="note" style="margin:0 0 4px"></p>
          <div class="code" data-label="Complete the sentence:">
            <div class="code-type" id="pgSentence" style="min-height:1.4em"></div>
          </div>
          <div id="pgChoices"></div>
          <div id="pgReveal" class="callout" style="display:none" aria-live="polite"></div>
          <button id="pgNext" class="sandbox-btn" type="button" style="display:none">Next round</button>
        </div>

        <h3>The upgrade: looking at the whole counter</h3>
        <p>
          LLMs use the same core mechanic—predict the next token—but instead of glancing at the last word or two,
          they look at everything currently on the counter (the full context window).
          That's why an LLM can connect "surgeon" to "scalpel" even when they're sentences apart:
          an <strong>attention mechanism</strong> lets it link distant but relevant ingredients.
        </p>

        <div class="truth"><strong>Kitchen truth:</strong> Your phone keyboard is a cook who only looks at the last ingredient added. An LLM is a cook who glances at the whole counter—but it's still cooking one ingredient at a time.</div>

        <details class="tip">
          <summary><strong>Power-up (optional): N-grams—the phone's cheat sheet</strong></summary>
          <p>
            An <strong>n-gram</strong> is a sequence of <em>n</em> consecutive words. Your phone's predictions are powered by tables of these:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Unigram (n = 1):</strong> single-word frequency. "The" is one of the most common English words, so it gets suggested constantly.</li>
            <li><strong>Bigram (n = 2):</strong> word pairs. After "of the" → "most" | "best" | "world." After "going to" → "be" | "the" | "get."</li>
            <li><strong>Trigram (n = 3):</strong> three-word chains. "One of the" → "most." "I want to" → "go" | "be" | "know."</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The phone stores a frequency table of these sequences (often personalized to your texting habits) and picks the highest-scoring match.
            The window is tiny—usually 1–3 words—so it has no ability to track meaning, themes, or instructions from earlier in the conversation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Try this: open your phone, type a word, then keep tapping the middle suggestion 20 times. You'll get a grammatically
            plausible but meaningless sentence—that's n-gram prediction running on autopilot with no broader understanding.
          </p>
        </details>

        <details class="tip">
          <summary><strong>Power-up (optional): Attention—how LLMs look at the whole counter</strong></summary>
          <p>
            In n-gram prediction, the model only sees a fixed window of 1–3 words. LLMs replace that tiny window with a mechanism called <strong>attention</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            For each new token the model is about to generate, attention assigns a <strong>relevance score</strong> between that position and
            every other token already on the counter. Think of it as the cook glancing back across all the ingredients and deciding which ones matter <em>right now</em>:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Generating after "up the"—attention lights up "surgeon" from earlier, boosting "scalpel."</li>
            <li>Generating after "with the"—attention lights up "marine biology," boosting "dolphins."</li>
            <li>Generating after "is the"—attention links "planets," "solar system," and "Jupiter," boosting "largest."</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This is the core of the <strong>transformer</strong> architecture (the "T" in GPT): instead of a fixed lookback window,
            every token can attend to every other token. The model learns <em>which</em> connections matter during training.
          </p>
          <p>
            The tradeoff: attention across all tokens is computationally expensive and scales with counter size—which is
            one reason context windows have limits and longer prompts cost more.
          </p>
        </details>

        <h3>Same prompt, different response</h3>
        <p>
          You may have noticed that entering the same prompt into the same LLM can produce different answers. The is because when the model generates text, it considers lots of possibilities for the next word (token) and scores them. Then the system <strong>chooses one</strong> based on a setting refered to as the <strong>tempurature</strong> which controls how strongly it sticks to the top choice vs. how willing it is to take a less-likely option.
        </p><p>  
          Imagine ordering chocolate chip cookies for dessert—a temperature of 0 means the chef follows the standard recipe exactly as written. A tempurature of 1 means the chef will put its own spin on the recipe, so you might get oatmeal chocolate chip or browned butter pecan, but you're still getting cookies. Now a tempurature of 2 means the chef can get truly creative and you might end up receiving spaghetti and watermelon balls with a chocolate marinara, topped with a candied fennel garnish.
        </p>
        <div class="grid">
          <div class="callout">
            <h3 style="margin-top:0">Standard recipe</h3>
            <p style="margin:0">Stable and repeatable (nearly the same each run).</p>
          </div>
          <div class="callout">
            <h3 style="margin-top:0">Chef’s special</h3>
            <p style="margin:0">Varied and improvisational (poetic or pure nonsense).</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="truth"><strong>Kitchen truth:</strong> Most models you'll encounter have a set tempurature, but some models do allow you to adjust it yourself.</div>

        <div class="sandbox-card" id="tempDemo">

        </div>

        <h3>Why prompts matter more than people expect</h3>
        <p>
          The model’s default job is to produce a coherent continuation of whatever you put in front of it.
          If your prompt is vague, “coherent” often means it picks an interpretation it thinks is most likely and commits—hello, <strong>chocolate spaghetti with watermelon</strong>.
          If your prompt is specific (gluten-free vegan chocolate chip cookies with cinnamon, no fruit or nuts), “coherent” shifts towards what you actually want.

        <h2>The Prep Counter: Context Windows, Drift, and “Forgetting”</h2>

        <p class="kicker"><strong>Hook:</strong> the disappearing allergy note</p>
        <p>
          You’re mid-service. Early on, the client said: <strong>no peanuts, severe allergy</strong>. Thirty messages later, you ask for a final menu.
          The model confidently suggests peanut satay. Did it “forget”? Or did something dumber (and more fixable) happen?
        </p>
        <div class="truth"><strong>Kitchen truth:</strong> If it’s not on the counter, the cook can’t use it—even if you said it earlier.</div>

        <h3>What the context window really is</h3>
        <p>
          The context window is the model’s counter space: the ticket + the visible conversation + any pasted references included for this turn.
          But the counter is not infinite. When it gets crowded, older items get pushed off to make room for what’s newest.
        </p>
        <div class="truth"><strong>Kitchen truth:</strong> A long chat doesn’t make a bigger brain—it makes a messier counter.</div>

        <h3>“Forgetting” isn’t amnesia. It’s occlusion.</h3>
        <p>
          The model generates from what it can currently see. If the allergy note isn’t visible in the current context, it can’t reliably follow it.
          This is why “forgetting” is really “out of frame.”
        </p>
        <div class="truth"><strong>Kitchen truth:</strong> The cook didn’t forget the rule—it just isn’t looking at it anymore.</div>

        <h3>How to pack the counter: recap blocks, constraints, and known-good facts</h3>
        <p>
          Treat the conversation like you’re periodically resetting your station. You don’t need more words—you need better compression.
          Keep three piles separate: known-good facts, constraints, and explicitly labeled assumptions/open questions.
        </p>
        <div class="truth"><strong>Kitchen truth:</strong> A recap block is how you keep yesterday’s decisions on today’s counter.</div>

          <p><strong>Start a new chat</strong> when you’re switching to a new deliverable, the thread has unresolved forks, or you keep saying “as we said earlier…”</p>
          <p><strong>Recap inject</strong> when you’re on the same deliverable, handing off to a new station, or a constraint is high-stakes.</p>

        <h2>Thermometers &amp; Scales: Tools That Stop Guessing</h2>

        <p class="kicker"><strong>Hook:</strong> the chicken that was “definitely done”</p>
        <p>
          The model can give you a confident answer that sounds right. But “sounds right” isn’t a standard when the stakes are real.
        </p>
        <div class="truth"><strong>Kitchen truth:</strong> The cook can narrate a steak. Only the thermometer can tell you it’s actually done.</div>

        <h3>What tools are (and what they aren’t)</h3>
        <p>
          A tool is any system that can touch reality or compute deterministically: calendars, spreadsheets, databases, web lookups, code execution,
          document search. Tools aren’t “better prompting.” Tools are measurement.
        </p>

        <div class="truth"><strong>Kitchen truth:</strong> If you didn’t measure it, you don’t know it.</div>

        <h3>The measurement loop: check → place on counter → plate with receipts</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Decide what must be true (the must-not-guess list).</li>
          <li>Use a tool to check it.</li>
          <li>Paste the tool output onto the counter.</li>
          <li>Ask the model to use only that evidence and cite it.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Receipts (not homework)</h3>
        <p>
          Here “citations” just means: where did that claim come from? If you can’t answer, the claim gets stamped
          <strong>NEEDS TOOL CHECK</strong> or <strong>MISSING INFO</strong>.

          <summary><strong>Add-on (optional): Agent Mode (auto-running the stations)</strong></summary>
          <p>
            Some AI products offer agent mode: you give a goal, and it plans, uses tools, and iterates until it thinks the job is done.
            In kitchen terms, it’s a shift lead that keeps writing sub-tickets, running instruments, and passing trays between stations—without waiting for you to drive each step.
          </p>
          <p><strong>What changes:</strong> the agent tries to run Prep List → Measurement → Draft → Expo for you.</p>
          <p><strong>What doesn’t:</strong> it’s still the same cook with the same counter space. If you don’t require checkpoints and receipts, it can sprint into confident nonsense faster.</p>

        <p class="note">
          Optional reading. The core guide teaches you how to work with any model. This bonus helps you understand why different models feel different—and how to pick one for a specific job.
        </p>

        <h3>Same ticket, different chef</h3>
        <p>
          Give the same ticket to two experienced cooks and you’ll get two different plates—not because one is “smart” and the other is “dumb,”
          but because they practiced different things. Models differ based on (1) what they trained on and (2) how they were trained.
        </p>
        <div class="truth"><strong>Kitchen truth:</strong> A model’s vibe is mostly a memory of what it practiced—and what it was rewarded for.</div>

        <h3>Training data is technique, not a searchable stockroom</h3>
        <p>
          Crucially: the model doesn’t store the training set like a library it can flip through mid-service. Training changes internal weights—more like muscle memory than a searchable cookbook.
        </p>

        <h3>Character Select: chef bios (placeholder roster)</h3>
